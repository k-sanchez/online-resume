    My main interest is the elucidation of the evolutionary history of natural populations. Specifically, I focus on species delimitation, phylogenetic relationships, and gene flow between populations/species. To achieve this I developed skills in the use of genetic, phenotypic, and environmental/geographic data given that evolutionary processes acts on multiple axes. During my PhD I worked on Liolaemus lizards, but I am open to explore other animal taxa as well.

    The experiences section in a resume is a section where you list your previous work experiences and accomplishments. It typically includes information about your previous job titles, companies you worked for, the dates of your employment, and your key responsibilities and achievements in each role. This section is important because it gives potential employers a sense of your work history and the skills and expertise you have developed over time. It can also help demonstrate your ability to contribute value to a new organization based on your past achievements.

    The project section in a resume is a section where you can highlight any significant projects that you have completed during your education, work experience, or personal endeavors. This section provides a detailed description of your projects that can showcase your skills, abilities, and achievements.

    In this section, you should include the name of the project, the role you played in the project, the duration, the tools and technologies you used, the objective of the project, and the outcome or result achieved. You can also include any relevant metrics or data that demonstrate the impact of the project.

    The project section is especially useful for candidates with limited work experience or those looking to highlight specific skills or accomplishments that may not be apparent in other parts of their resume. It can also be beneficial for candidates in technical or creative fields, where projects play a significant role in showcasing their capabilities.

    The award section in a resume is a dedicated section where you can showcase any awards you have received. This section is particularly relevant for individuals who have received awards for their work in their field, such as employees who have received performance awards or industry-specific awards. In this section, you should list the name of the award, the organization or institution that awarded it, the date it was awarded, and any other relevant details.

    When including your awards on your resume, be sure to focus on the most significant or relevant awards that showcase your skills and expertise. If you have received a long list of awards, you may want to consider including only the most recent or prestigious awards on your resume.

    By highlighting your awards, you can demonstrate your achievements and accomplishments in your field, and can help differentiate yourself from other candidates. However, if you have not received any awards, it is not necessary to include this section in your resume.

    The patent section in a resume is a dedicated section where you can showcase any patents that you have been granted or are in the process of obtaining. This section is particularly relevant for individuals who work in scientific or technical fields, as well as for individuals who have developed innovative products or technologies.

    In this section, you should list the title of the patent, the name of the inventors, the patent number, and the date it was granted. If the patent is pending, you can indicate that it is "pending" or "in review." You may also want to provide a brief description of the technology or invention that the patent covers.

    Including a patent section in your resume can help demonstrate your expertise and accomplishments in your field, and can help you stand out from other candidates. However, if you do not have any patents to list, it is not necessary to include this section in your resume.

    Template for a pending patent:

    + [Inventor Name]. [Pursued Year]. [Title]. [Patent Number], filed [Submitted Date]. Patent pending.

    Template for an approved patent:

    The organization section in a resume, specifically for social contexts, is a section where you can showcase any relevant involvement or leadership positions in social, cultural, or community organizations. This section can highlight your commitment to social causes and your ability to work collaboratively with others towards a common goal.

    In this section, you can list the name of the organization, your role and responsibilities, the duration of your involvement, and any significant achievements or accomplishments.
